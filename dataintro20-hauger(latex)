\section{Introduction}
This document should show what I've learned to do in Latex as well as my skills in \emph{the terminal} and \emph{Github}

\subsection{Why I'm writing in English}
I'm writing in English because i come from Norway, so I'm not completely fluent in writing Swedish yet. English however, is a language that I've studied extensively over several years, and I'm also born an partly raised in England. This document is a test in tech-skills, so i figured that it would be alright if i wrote it in English. 

\section{Laziness}
While trying to find out what to write about in this document, the most obvious choice would be \emph{nothing} because in that way i don't have to think at all while writing, and i can just go on and on and on and on and on and on. I could type in some examples from the introduction guides like: 
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}
{2a}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k
\end{equation}
But to actually do some of my assignment I should get serious. The first thing that I want to do is to post a picture that I have stored on my computer of me and a friend on a walk in the hills around Oslo on a hot summer day. And right after that, there is a table that i made conisting of absolutely random data. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{walk.jpeg}
    \caption{A picture of yours truly on a walk}
    \label{fig:picture}
\end{figure}
\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{rccccl}
         \(\beta\) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & $\sum\) \\
\toprule
         \(S_o(\beta)\) & 4 & 7 & 3 & 9 & 23 \\
\(S_i(\beta)\) & 2 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 12 \\
\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Random data}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}
Or i could show that i know how to use the itemize funktion i latex to list some things i find amusing such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item cats
\item comedy
\end{itemize}
I could even list them one after the other: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item comedy
\item cats
\end{enumerate}
But i wouldn't know when to stop 

\subsection{Some of my own testing}
In this section I am going to systematically try out some of the functions here in latex so that I'll learn how to navigate the system. 

First I'll start with the maths. Here I'll write down some formulas that I've used in high-school physics: 
\begin{equation}
    U_{AB} = \frac{W_{AB}}{q}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \sum I_j = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    U = U_m \sin{\omega t} , U_m = nBA \omega
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    B ( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{n^2} ) = hf ,  n > m
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \lambda - \lambda_0 = \lambda_c (1 - \cos \alpha) 
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{The reference}
Making a reference can be hard at times\footnote{note that it is easier if you have a subject} but I'll give it my best shot. I want to refer to my favourite book where four bright people explain how to use data types, that according to the book\footnote{i have never read the book and highly doubt that any of them ever expressed this meaning} was more important than their children \cite{Sedgewick2015itp}

And last, but not least, I'm going to show the history of my terminal without loging into student shell: 

\lstset{language=bash}
  \ 15  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 16  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se\\
   \ 17  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 18  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 19  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
  \ 20  ssh hauger@student.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 21  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 22  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 23  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 24  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 25  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 26  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
  \ 27  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 28  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 29  ssh hauger @student-shell.sys.kth.se \\
   \ 30  ssh hauger@student-shell.sys.kth.se\\
